        <p>As a problem solver who loves facing challenges in my work, I'm excited to be at the deployment phase of my career as a web developer. I'm passionate and ambitious about my work, and love to be on a team that questions possibilities. I've previously been an animator, and bring those skills to my UI development on a team. Independently, I've accomplished website building projects as a freelancer for over two years.</p>
